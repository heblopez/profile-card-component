## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

This project helped me to reinforce the use of Tailwind CSS, as it is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and styling of components.

```tsx
  function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <div
          className="
            absolute top-[-75vh] left-[-200vw]
            desktop:left-[-25vw]
            desktop:top-[-90vh]
            xl-desktop:left-[-15vw]
            xl-desktop:top-[-50vh]
            w-[978px] h-[978px]
            bg-[url('./assets/bg-pattern-top.svg')]
            bg-no-repeat z-0
          "
        ></div>
        <ProfileCard />
        <div
          className="
            absolute bottom-[-75vh] right-[-200vw]
            desktop:right-[-25vw]
            desktop:bottom-[-90vh]
            xl-desktop:right-[-15vw]
            xl-desktop:bottom-[-50vh]
            w-[978px] h-[978px]
            bg-[url('./assets/bg-pattern-bottom.svg')]
            bg-no-repeat z-0
          "
        ></div>
      </>
    )
  }
```

### Continued development

Working on this project made me notice that Tailwind is very versatile allowing us to create new classes from the configuration file, according to the customization we are looking for our project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This is the official Tailwind CSS website, where you will find all the Tailwind classes we have available to use, examples of use and how to create classes with custom settings.
